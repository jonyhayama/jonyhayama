### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

#### ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡·

Sou doido por programaÃ§Ã£o. SÃ©rio. Desde que fiz meu primeiro cursinho de Web Design hÃ¡ 17 anos atrÃ¡s (e fui contratado para lecionar nessa escola) nunca parei.

Mineiro com orgulho, sou um desenvolvedor no estilo "me dÃ¡ esse trem aÃ­ que eu faÃ§o". JÃ¡ trabalhei com HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, Ruby on Rails, VueJS, Elixir, WordPress e estou sempre disposto a "dar um pitaco"

I'm crazy about coding. Seriously. Since my first Web Design course 17 years back (after which I was hired by the school I've studied at) I've never stopped.

Proudly from "Minas Gerais" (Brazilian state), I'm a give-it-to-me-that-i'll-figure-it-out kind of developer. I've already worked with HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, Ruby on Rails, VueJS, Elixir, WordPress, and I'm always available to share a thought.
